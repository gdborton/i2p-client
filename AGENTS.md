## Project Description

We're building an i2p client library.

- The SAM v3 spec that we're building against is here:
- https://geti2p.net/en/docs/api/samv3
- read and understand the spec before suggesting/making changes
- sam.ts contains the SAM client implemenation.

## Testing instructions

- Run `pnpm tsc` to check the types.
- Run `pnpm test` to run the full suite of tests.
- Fix any tests or errors until the entire suite goes green.
